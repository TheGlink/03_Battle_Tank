# 03_Battle_Tank
An arena battle game, in which you operate a tank and have to destroy all other tanks to win. featuring simple AI, terrain and an advanced 
control system in Unreal Engine 4

This will be completed following the Unreal Engine C++ development course by Ben Tristem on Udemy.

## Goals
* Understand the creation process of more advanced games in Unreal Engine.
* Challenge myself to go beyond the scope of the project, possibly improve the AI and/or terrain
* Improve my ability to solve problems with regards to programming as a whole
* Progress on towards other Unreal Engine C++ courses, such as online multiplayer and VR
* Create even a small game as a personal project, either alone or with friends.

any comments are appresciated, if anyone else even sees this, keep in mind that I am rather new to coding.
